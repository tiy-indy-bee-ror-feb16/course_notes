# Class policies, procedures & rules

What follows are the important bits to keep in mind as far as how this course functions and what you should expect going in.

## Code of Conduct

# TODO: Replace with "official" CoC from student bulletin

Like the technical community as a whole, classes at The Iron Yard are made up of a mixture of people from all different backgrounds.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to when they're taking a class at The Iron Yard. These rules apply equally to teachers, students, other staff, and guest lecturers.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us, and the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all communication: this includes in class, Slack, email, and other forums such as Skype, Google+ Hangouts, etc.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by talking to your instructor. If you do not feel comfortable talking to your instructor, speak with any Iron Yard staff member.

_We are there to help._

* **Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.**
* **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect your colleagues, and you should take those consequences into
account when making decisions.
* **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Iron Yard community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the Iron Yard community.
* **Be careful in the words that you choose.** Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other people. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary behavior are not appropriate for this class. This includes, but is not limited to:
  * Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  * Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
  * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention.
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if
    someone asks you to stop, then stop.
* **When we disagree, we try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and The Iron Yard is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different. The strength of The Iron Yard comes from its varied members, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere, rather offer to help resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes.

## Homework Policies

* **All assignments are due at 7am before class begins.**
* **No assignments should include copy and pasted code other than boilerplate set up code for gems that we will use later in the class.**
* **No assignments should include code lifted or 'borrowed' from someone else without proper citation and licensing.**
* **Incomplete homework is better than late homework.**
* **Late homework is better than no homework.**
* **Asking for clarity or help on assignments is encouraged.**
* **Turning in code that you do not understand is discouraged and should be noted so we can address those issues.**

Each day's homework builds on previous homework. Homework completion is largely how we gauge student progress. If a student falls below 75% homework completion in the course, graduation status is in peril.

## Honesty Policy

>"Honesty is more than not lying. It is truth telling, truth speaking, truth living, and truth loving."
>-James E. Faust

* __Honest with your feedback__

* __Honest with your homework__

* __Honest with your understanding__

* __Honest with your feelings__

* __Honest with your peers__

* __Honest with yourself__


We cannot stress enough the importance of honesty and open communication.

For the sake of Clarity, we'll define Honesty as:

> Honesty - sincere, blameless, fairly earned, simple, unpretentious, and free of deceit.

Being dishonest - especially when it comes to misrepresenting the work you're doing for class (read: cheating) - can and will be dealt with _harshly_. To be specific: expulsion is very much on the table. Don't do it. There's no reason to do it.

You're only cheating yourself.

## Communication Policy

* More is better than less
* A peer is better than a google search
* A google search is better than staring into the abyss
* Stargazing is better than giving up
* Asking for help is always encouraged
* "I don't understand" is a valid and encouraged thing to say
* Sharing is good, but always include a source. Do not spread misinformation
* Slack is your friend
* Be open when you are struggling, feeling behind, or overwhelmed. We're all in this together and we're all here to help.

## Office Hours

Your instructor will be available Monday-Friday from 9am until ~5pm. There might be meetings, lunch breaks and other things that come up, but during those times, they will be there to answer questions and help.

After hours, access is not guaranteed - a response is _likely_ to happen, not perhaps not quickly. You are welcome to and encouraged to use Slack in those circumstances, however.

Our suggestion: Post questions in the Slack channel for your cohort to widen the pool of available help.

After all, you're all in this together.
